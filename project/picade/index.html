<p>When I heard that Nintendo was releasing the NES Classic Edition, it sounded somewhat nostalgic. The simplicity of the games and the ease with which they could be played sounded appealing. After a little background research, I found that the current trend for retro gaming machines is actually quite limiting - i.e. you only get a small range of &lsquo;good&rsquo; games, and there is no way to update them with &lsquo;new&rsquo; stuff.  I wanted to build something myself that would give me all of the 8-bit playing fun, but something that I could create, control and learn from.  I wanted to do more stuff with a Raspberry Pi, so this ticked all the boxes.  Cue the ordering and a lost weekend of putting things together.</p>
<p>The OS <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/"><code>RetroPie</code></a> is essentially a modified verion of the Raspberry Pi OS, that enables you to turn a Raspberry Pi into a retro arcade system. I buy most of my Raspberry Pi resources from <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/"><code>Pimoroni</code></a> and noticed a product called <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picade?variant=29210087489619"><code>Picade</code></a> that uses the RetroPie OS as part of a fully-fledged aracde machine.  Ok, it isn&rsquo;t a full-size cabinet, but it sounds amazing and it feels realistic with the clicky buttons and joystick.</p>
<p>The last time I had worked with electronics was in high school and I didn&rsquo;t forget how &lsquo;fiddly&rsquo; it can be!  Thankfully there was no soldering involved. Pimoroni provides a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrPI7ljHbhc&amp;list=PLsqZYLz3jrKDsDV4A_TMBlu1gh_pRp0iT"><code>video series</code></a> that details in a step-by-step manner how to assemble everything and configure the software. During my build I accidently broke the clamp that connects the screen to a &lsquo;display driver board&rsquo; (the electronics between the Pi and the screen). Pimoroni does advise that this can potentially happen and that a replacement would need to be bought. The Pimoroni customer service team were very quick to help and even sent links to different videos for this tricky part so that I didn&rsquo;t require another replacement.  Everything went fine.</p>
<p>The process of getting a RetroPie image onto a microSD card was made quite easy thanks to the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-imager-imaging-utility/"><code>Raspberry Pi Imager</code></a>. However, when I booted the Pi for the first time, it would not run. I did the simple checks of ensuring that the Pi was plugged in, as well as checking all the cable connections, but nothing was working.  After a bit of research I identified the root of the problem. When I had first started the build, RetroPie was not then compatible with the Raspberry Pi 4 (which I was using). The only option immediately available was a workround based around an older version of the operating system.  That sounded like a step backwards, so I decided to wait for RetroPie developers to release
an update.</p>
<p>When RetroPie released their Pi 4 version, I promptly installed it, but still nothing was coming to life. I could see from the Raspberry Pi that it was receiving power, but for some reason I wasn&rsquo;t getting any screen output. To troubleshoot, I connected the Picade to my main monitor and I could see that video signals were coming through. I looked at the ribbon cable sockets used for the Picade&rsquo;s driver board output and noticed a small piece of plastic
blocking a full connection.  I removed this and the problem was sorted.</p>
<p>The next step was to ensure that the Picade was detecting the wired joystick. To do this I had to connect a keyboard to the Raspberry Pi, access the RetroPie command line (F4 key) and clone the <a href="https://github.com/pimoroni/picade-hat"><code>Pimoroni Picade repository</code></a> from Github.  The arcade was now &lsquo;working&rsquo; but it wasn&rsquo;t playable. RetroPie relies on game emulators to play game &lsquo;ROMS&rsquo; that have to be downloaded.</p>
<p>However, the problem with ROMS is that many companies still have copyright over all the games (the ca$h grabbing Nintendo being the main culprit).  This means that there is no legitimate place to get game ROMS even if the game has been out for over 20 years. Now &hellip;. level with me Nintendo.  I am an avid gamer, and have spent a small fortune on games in the past and no doubt I will continue to do this in the future.  How on earth is someone going to be a threat to you if they just want to remind themselves of their childhood playing Super Mario Bros?</p>
<p>The ROMS games themselves actually are of no monetary value today, and no, even if I COULD play them, it still wouldn&rsquo;t stop me from buying new games. The most respected ROM and emulator provider <a href="https://www.emuparadise.me/"><code>Emuparadise</code></a> was hit with a lawsuit by Nintendo back in 2018 which forced many of the emulators and ROMS available to be taken offline. The only other option for getting ROMS and emulators is through shady websites that have reportedly been a source of malware.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun putting the Picade together, and I did learn quite a bit of stuff that I will put to good use in the future.  However, unless large gaming companies like Nintendo realise that we just want to play <strong>RETRO</strong> games for a bit of short-term nostalgia, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of point in building a Picade.  Unless of course you want to <a href="https://store.rpipress.cc/collections/latest-bookazines/products/code-the-classics"><code>Code the Classics</code></a> yourself.</p>
