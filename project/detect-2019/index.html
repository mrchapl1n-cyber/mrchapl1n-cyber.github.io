          <h2 id="my-conference-speaking-experience">My conference speaking experience</h2>
<p>During my placement/internship year I worked for the threat intelligence company Anomali as part of the Anomali Threat Research (ATR) team. I was offered the opportunity to speak at the company&rsquo;s annual conference DETECT. By the time I got to
the hotel I had been awake for approximately 30-35 hours, so just a bit tired to say the least. I met up with my team and headed to the keynote where the main speakers included <code>Admiral Michael Rogers, the former director for the  National Security Agency (NSA)</code>. Being able to listen to such experienced individuals within the intelligence community was an amazing experience.</p>
<p>After the keynote on Monday, the subject of the first talk I attended described how ISIS had evolved its operations to increase their online presence as well as ensure secure communications between members. Afterwards, I went to a talk related to automating open source intelligence (OSINT) gathering. This was a very interesting
presentation - OSINT work can be quite difficult to automate due to inconsistencies between different data sources and the unstructured nature of the data itself.</p>
<p>On the second day of the conference, my team delivered a series of presentations, so I focused on them to pick up some last minute tips on how to deliver my own talk. After an intense day of learning so many new things, Anomali held a conference party for all the attendees. The room was styled with a Guardians of the Galaxy theme. A fun way to unwind and socialize with my co-workers and Anomali customers.</p>
<p>On the final day it was my turn to present <a href="https://www.anomali.com/resources/webcasts/ransomware-from-humble-beginnings-to-monster-of-masses-detect-series"><code>Ransomware - From Humble Beginnings to Monster of Masses</code></a>. The narrative for my talk described the evolution of ransomware and how it could potentially change in the future. It was pretty nerve-racking as I hadn&rsquo;t done any form
of public speaking since high school.  The conference attendees weren&rsquo;t high schoolers but industry professionals.</p>
<p>Each talk had a 5 minute &lsquo;Q &amp; A&rsquo;, where the speakers were asked questions by members of the audience.  It was a first-time experience for me in this respect too - answering questions from so many people representing so many different skill levels, industries and organisations, including the U.S. military and other players in the threat intel space.</p>
<p>Overall, being able to deliver a talk and answer questions was a confidence building experience that has helped me to develop personally and professionally. I was very thankful to my managers and leadership for the opportunity to speak at the conference.  I was also appreaciative of the support and encouragement of my peers who were instrumental in helping me prepare for the event.  I would certainly encourage my peers to do the same thing, if such an opportunity ever becomes available to them.</p>
